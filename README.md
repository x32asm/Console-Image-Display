# Console-Image-Display
Console Image Display (IDS) is an image viewer that was built entirely within the windows console in C++.
All of the image processing is done with OpenCV 3.4.3.

<b>Features:</b>

    Works with all image types
    Greyscale / Ascii mode
    Automatic image resizing (for really big / small images)
    Adjustable font size


IDS works by taking command line arguments specifying the image to be displayed, the font size of the image, and image options.

<b>Usage:</b>

	options / flags:
		a,	ascii			displays the image using ascii characters [0x20 (32) - 0x7E (127)]
		g,	greyscale		displays the image as greyscale
		
	command format:
		*.exe <image path> [font size] [options]

if flag -a is left out of the arguments the image will be displayed using ascii character 0xDB (219)

When using IDS make sure not to use ctrl + c to exit the program (instead just press any character) as this will prevent IDS from setting the console properties back to a default setting. If you accidentally stop executing with ctrl + c you can either run IDS again with any image and exit the program properly or use the ConsoleFix program included in the bin folder to reset you command prompt (sometimes just closing the console and re-opening it works too)
